# SDK Kotlin V2

This module provides some very simple examples to show case the use of the Kotlin SDK.

It focuses on Cells server API v2.

> **Warning**: it is quite easy to update the Cells Server. In order to reduce the amount of work
> necessary to update and maintain the SDK, we only support Cells Servers in v5 or superior.

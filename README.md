# Pydio Cells SDK for kotlin

[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) SDK for communicating with a Pydio Cells Server.


It provides:

- an automatically generated API client using [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger)
- [TODO] a transport layer that handles authentication and wraps AWS SDK for file transfers
- [TODO] a bunch of basic examples that use this SDK to perform simple actions on a running Cells server instance
